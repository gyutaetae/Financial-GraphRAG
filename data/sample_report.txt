NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Third Quarter
Fiscal 2026
Record revenue of $57.0 billion, up 22% from Q2 and up 62% from a year ago
Record Data Center revenue of $51.2 billion, up 25% from Q2 and up 66% from a year ago
 
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue for the third quarter ended October 26, 2025, of $57.0 billion, up
22% from the previous quarter and up 62% from a year ago.
For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 73.4% and 73.6%, respectively.
For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were both $1.30.
“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.
“Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially.
We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI
startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”
During the first nine months of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $37.0 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased
and cash dividends. As of the end of the third quarter, the company had $62.2 billion remaining under its share repurchase
authorization.
NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 26, 2025, to all shareholders of record on
December 4, 2025.

Conference Call and Webcast Information
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and
current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the
conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be
recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal
2026.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company
uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP
gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other
income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For
NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a
reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures
to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable
and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax
impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less
both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment
and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall
understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial
measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other
companies.
